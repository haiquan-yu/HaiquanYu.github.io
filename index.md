## About Me

Hello! My name is Haiquan Yu. I am a master’s student at the School of Software, Dalian University of Technology, starting in 2024, and I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Fangming Zhong. My research focuses on multimodal feature alignment and cross-modal learning under noisy conditions. I am also deeply interested in large language models and video understanding.

If you’re interested in collaboration or just want to chat, feel free to get in touch!
